- once you are done with that, commit the file to save all changes with the command, git commit -m "a message for the commot" p.s. you need to have a message when committing
- once that is done, you can push the new changes to your remote repository with the command. git push origin main. Instead of main you can write the name of your target branch 
- in order to make sure that the changes are saved on your remote directory, go to github and create a pull request
